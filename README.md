Gainesville Hackerspace name-badge project 1

Our first pass at a single-sided aluminum printed circuit board.  The PCB is laid out in KiCAD.  

The microcontroller is a AVR 0-Series ATTINY202.  

The initial firmware is written in the Arduino IDE.  See https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore/ for the board manager.
